# appetit README

This is a basic extension for Appetit for Visual Studio Code. NOTE: given my unfamilarity with the VS Code API and my rusty knowledge of JS, this is likely the least stable and consistent part of the Appetit projects. 

Features:
* Syntax highlighting support.
* Snippet support for each implemented statement, often accessible via the first two letters of each statement.
* Actions for Command Palette:
    * Commenting for selected text (Appetit: Comment Line(s))
    * Remove commenting for selected text (Appetit: Uncomment Line(s))
